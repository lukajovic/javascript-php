        <p id="javaParagraf">Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based,
            object-oriented,and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It
            is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere"(WORA), meaning that compiled Java
            code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.Java applications
            are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer
            architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use,
            particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.Java was
            originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle
            Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language
            derives much of its original features from SmallTalk, with a syntax similar to C and C++, but it has fewer
            low-level facilities than either of them.</p>

        <h3 id="javaScriptH3">Programski jezik Javascript</h3>
        <p id="javaScriptParagraf">JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level,
            interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is
            also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. Alongside HTML and CSS,
            JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web
            pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast
            majority of websites use it,and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute
            it.As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including
            object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates,
            regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking,
            storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.</p>
